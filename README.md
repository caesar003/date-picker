# Datepicker

It's been a very long time actually that I really want to create my own date-picker, something really simple. Of course, a lot of people have written this kind of thing in the past, with a lot more sophisticated ways and methods, fancy features. Just the sake of learning, way to understand what are really going on. 

## Guide 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/caesar003/date-picker.git
